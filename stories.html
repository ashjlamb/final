                    <h3>Mora's Journey</h3>
                    <p>In early 2008, Mora Leeb began having epileptic seizures that became more and more frequent. 
                        "There were 20 of them in a minute and then there were hundreds of them a day," Leeb says.
                        Doctors ordered an MRI of Mora's brain. They showed the image to Ann and her husband, Seth.
                        Most of the cells in her left hemisphere had died. The ones that remained were causing her unrelenting seizures.
                        So the Leebs traveled from their home in South Orange, New Jersey, to the Cleveland Clinic, where Dr. William Bingaman performed a hemispherectomy, which removes most of the tissue on one side of the brain.
                         "Basically the surgery created a newborn," Leeb says. "She could no longer roll over. She could no longer smile. It was almost like a restart."
                        "At 18 months, she finally sat up," Leeb says. "And at 23 months she finally walked."
                        Mora was 6 and a half when she began using sentences. By the time she had her bat mitzvah, she was able to give a short speech about living with half a brain.
                         People like Mora represent the upper bounds of human brain plasticity because their brains were radically altered very early in life — a period when the wiring is still a work in progress.</p>

                    <h3>Cameron's Journey</h3>
                    <p>For three years, little Cameron Mott’s life was a nightmarish succession of violent seizures that consumed her days and threatened her life.
                         Finally, doctors told her parents there was a way to stop them: All they had to do was remove half of Cameron’s brain. 
                         Finally, doctors put a name on the condition: Rasmussen’s syndrome, a condition that causes the destruction of one side of the brain. The 
                         solution was radical. It’s called a hemispherectomy, which means the removal of half of the brain. Since the left side of the body is controlled 
                         by the right side of the brain, doctors knew that Cameron would be paralyzed on her left side when she awoke. Cameron was immobilized for the first 
                         two days after the surgery to allow her brain to stabilize. Then she went into an intensive physical therapy program. Four weeks after the surgery, 
                         she walked out of the hospital.Cameron was able to return to school, where she is now in the second grade and a good student. Her physical therapy 
                         sessions have just recently ended, and she can run and play, although she has a slight limp and still wears a brace on her left leg. She also has lost 
                         some peripheral vision.
